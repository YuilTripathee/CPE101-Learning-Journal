# Introductions

Hi, I'm **Yuil Tripathee** and I'm here to share my learning journey through the **CPE101 Engineering Exploration class**. I've experienced ups and downs, highs and lows, excitement and panic, a breathtaking experience because of the wide variety of topics being covered in the course. Moreover, building robots for the first time from scratch came up to me as a challenging and thrilling experience. In addition to academics and technology during the coursework, we also uncovered a lot of new topics from the soft skill part that is definitely going to help us innovate pragmatically and better address the needs of society.

I hope you would enjoy reading about my experience and comprehension from the CPE101 class.
