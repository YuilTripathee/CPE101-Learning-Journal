# #1 - Gambler bot



## Challenge criteria

### Ramp requirements

These are the requirements of the ramp to drop the dice.

The work was to pick up and drop the dice on the target:

Target dimensions:

* Rectangular platform
* Dimensions (h=45mm, w=92mm, l=92mm)

Dimensions of cubic dice:

* `A`: Rounded edge, (15 x 15 x 15) mm
* `B`: Rounded edge, (12 x 12 x 12) mm

Terrain:

* PVC flooring
* Slippering (but still workable for micro:Bit Robot Platform)

## Bot requirements

Servo turn: 180 degrees

Options:

1. Rack and pinion system
2. Standard servo-based rotation

Dropping slider ramp:

Drop triangle (right triangle): $$h = 50 \text{mm, } b = 50\cos{60\degree}\text{, } p = 25 \text{mm}$$, keeping the \$$$\theta$$$  by testing the ramp going through 30, 45, and 60 degrees (for standard servo-based rotation system).
