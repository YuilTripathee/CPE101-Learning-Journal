We had learned about the terms AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning during this week.

## Coursework (the 'what?') ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capacity of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to carry out operations frequently performed by intelligent beings. This is a broad area of computer science that is focused with creating intelligent machines that can complete jobs. AI allows robots to adapt to new input, learn from past experiences, and carry out activities like to those performed by humans using a dataset. We also learned about deep learning, a form of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics how people learn specific kinds of information.

In the class, we also prepared a word cloud about the AI applications, these were some of the uses that caught my attention:

- AI can **automate mundane tasks** and free up resources for more complex tasks.
- AI can improve decision-making processes by providing **data-driven insights**.
-  AI can analyze large datasets quickly and accurately.
- AI can recognize patterns in data and can use this knowledge to inform decisions.
- AI can process natural language, enabling humans to interact with machines using voice or text.
- AI can help in the development of autonomous vehicles and robotics.
- AI can be used to detect fraud and financial risks.
- AI can help identify health issues and recommend treatments.

These were the potential applications that inspired me to dig deep into AI.

AI and ML are related but distinct fields. AI is a broad field of technology that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can think and make decisions like humans. ML, on the other hand, is a specific subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions. AI is a more general field that includes ML, as well as other techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.

We explored several topics in the session, which can be checked in the bottom part of the reflective writing (if it happens to be your interest).

## Impact  (the 'so what?') üöÄ

We can gain competitite edge in business by automation, improve customer service, design better product, reduce cost of human errors and have data driven insights.

The lab session we had after the instruction part was a stepping store to explore AI projects. Before then I had always wanted to learn about AI but entry to this topic was tool confusing and vague especially when we don't have mentions. I am eternally grateful to P'North for this wonderful session.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') ü§î

AI may be used to create engaging learning activities like project-based learning and gamified learning, among others. And Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), is the branch of computational science that is concerned with the analysis and interpretation of patterns and structures in data to enable learning, reasoning, and decision-making without the involvement of a human.

With this sessions and learning materials provided, now I have a good roadmap and interest to explore more about AI technologies, trends and applications. Moreover, it helped me get involved in the first hand rather than being an audience spectating other players in this technology. I also got to clear my misconception that I had before, regarding the technicalities of AI deployment to the client sides.

#### Key notes üìù

**What is artificial intelligence?**

* Concept is to learn from experience (Alan Turing, Turing machine at 1953) on his report published on 1948 (Intelligent Machines)

**Evolution of AI**

* AI (1950s) was the era of Turing's work
* ML (1980s) brought things like spam filtering
* DL (2010s) brought topics like back propagation

**Machine Learning**

* TED Talk by Fei Fei Li (How we're teaching machine to understand pictures?)
* Traditional process: data + rules -> outcome
* ML process: data + outome -> rules

**Types of Machine Learning** _Based on process_: Unsupervised, Semi Supervised, Supervised, Reinforcement (reward-based)

_Based on structural data:_ Linear regression, KNN (K-nearest neighbor), Decision Tree

_For Time Series Data:_ ARIMA, Long Short Term Memory, Recurrent Neural Network

_For Natural Language:_ Also, long short term memory, Transformer model (too complex and hard to learn and use compared to others)

_For image data:_ Convolutional neural network (CNN), Vision transformer, YOLOv7

**Real world usage examples:**

1. Netflix recommendation (clustering model)
2. Falcon 9 landing (gliding system)
3. Tesla (Level 2 Automation) driver's assistance autopilot
4. Midjourney Image Generator

> What do you want AI to do? -> question (on mentimeter word cloud)

**ML Tools**: _Programming languages:_ Python üåü, Scala, Java R

Models:

* CNN (Conovlutional Neural Network)
* ANN (Artificial Neural Network), a part of Deep learning
* GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)
* Transformers model (huge but accurate) - state of the art model nowadays

Tools:

1. Pandas - data preprocessing, data frame, import & cleaning
2. sklearn - models, criteria mindmapping
3. TF Keras
4. YOLO - Computer Vision, Object Detection
5. Kaggle - Find Datasets & example notebooks
6. Papers with code - latest papers and extra datasets
7. Teachable Machine (easily learning ML)

#### New ideas üí°

* the above key points are commonly found in general talk about machine learning, but most of the miss the calibration metrics part using confusion matrix (it is whether a model is accurate enough to deploy or not)
* Machine Learning follows Garbage In, Garbage Out workflow. Therefore, quality of data is very much crucial for proper functioning.
* Imbalance in datasheet?
  * Solution: more data, sampling method
* Also, I got the opportunity to clear some of the issues I've encountered when exploring machine learning on my own:
  1. Data format of model (JSON/Binary) - Flat file, memory, python variable? Each ML infrastructure has their own, and wrapper to work with client side with quality documentation. Therefore, no more hurdles to worry about.
  2. Deploy (JS, Qt, Flutter)? Web is the best option (JS). Flutter is quite broken. Backend and REST approach is quite laggy.
  3. Starting a career!
  4. How to choose project \[hackathon]? (hackathon/technology/fun) work with example projects a lot as a beginner

#### Resources üéÅ

* Papers with Code (state of art ML workflow and papers) + extra datasets
* Kaggle to start the work with AI, DL, ML
