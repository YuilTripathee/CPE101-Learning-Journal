  * A few things to remember:
    * We are building fences, not walls
    * You can lock the door, but it is not good if the windows is open
    * A secure system is only _as strong as its weakest link_
    * And that could be you

  * Cyber terrorism - _motivated use of computers_
  * Cyber warfars
