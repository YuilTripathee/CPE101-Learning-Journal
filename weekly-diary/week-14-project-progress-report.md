# Week 14 - Project Progress Report

November 25, 2022

Unlike other lecture classes, that day we had to present the progress of our project. We prepared for the progress presentation and demonstrated our project accomplishments to the other professors and TAs. Our group decided to create an AR game. In front of the TAs and other ajahns, we discussed the issues we had encountered, and they provided suggestions on what should be done to prevent future issues.

## Impact  (the 'so what?') 🚀

Although we didn't learn anything directly, the Professors and TAs gave us feedback and suggestions for the project. And when we work for a company, I think we receive training on how to present a progress presentation to clients and the team leader.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') 🤔

By obtaining numerous comments, both positive and negative, from the professors and TAs, we can better identify the areas that need improvement. Even though it will be difficult for us to complete our topic on time, we must try our best and use the feedback provided.
