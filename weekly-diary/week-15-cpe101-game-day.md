# Week 15 - CPE101 Game Day

December 1, 2022

I had signed up to play 'Poker' on the CPE Game Day event. It was a new game to me and I'm also not familiar to card game. I don't even play them on screen. So I decided to grab this exciting opportunity and learn it for real.

## Coursework (the 'what?') 🤷‍♂️

It is a card game.

I could not even play properly. I had to constant check the ranks of high cards on my phone throughout the game (until I got eliminated).

## Impact  (the 'so what?') 🚀

How the session turned out to be of value if it did?

> * Just wondering about the syllabus.
> * Relatable to the work we do currently.

Being involved in any games or sports brings us the sense of mindfulness. Also, I could not help hiding the fact that game arena is a healthy way we can replicate our day chores (like teamwork, ettiquettes, and many more). People have to break ranks and come face to face in order to play the game, which breaks the absurdity and communication barrier as compared to events of any other formal settings.

These are the overall good impacts that I've felt so far. Games do not have side effect implicitly, it depends on the self control of player. We must know our boundaries and learn our distance with the game (as of hobby or career), to lead a healthy playful life.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') 🤔

I also enjoyed re-watching the Casino Royale (2006 movie) and this time I've been finally able to understand this card game that went through the entire movie. It was very refreshing, since I was biased with the fact that card games are mental drain and it is only a game of luck.

After the attendance of this event, I've realized games are essential part of our work to maintain or health and well being. Moreover, they are very useful for socializing and making useful connections.
