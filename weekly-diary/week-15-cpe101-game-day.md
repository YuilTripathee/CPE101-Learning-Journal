# Week 15 - CPE101 Game Day 'Poker'

December 1, 2022

I had signed up to play 'Poker' at the CPE Game Day event. It was a new game to me and I'm also not familiar with card games. I don't even play them on screen. So I decided to grab this exciting opportunity and learn it for real.

## Coursework (the 'what?') ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It is a card game.

I could not even play properly. I had to constantly check the ranks of high cards on my phone throughout the game (until I got eliminated).

Also, I participated in playing with a Nintendo ring (which was also an equally fun experience). It is a game controller that lets us play interactive games and also doing good physical exercises.:

## Impact (the 'so what?') üöÄ

Being involved in any games or sports brings us a sense of mindfulness. Also, I could not help hiding the fact that the game arena is a healthy way, so can replicate our day chores (like teamwork, etiquette, and many more). People have to break ranks and come face to face in order to play the game, which breaks the absurdity and communication barrier as compared to events of any other formal setting.

These are the overall good impacts that I've felt so far. Games do not have side effects implicitly, it depends on the self-control of the player. We must know our boundaries and learn our distance from the game (as of hobby or career), to lead a healthy playful life.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') ü§î

I also enjoyed re-watching Casino Royale (2006 movie) and this time I've been finally able to understand this card game that went through the entire movie. It was very refreshing since I was biased with the fact that card games are mental drain and it is only a game of luck.

After the attendance of this event, I realized games are an essential part of our work to maintain our health and well-being. Moreover, they are very useful for socializing and making useful connections.
