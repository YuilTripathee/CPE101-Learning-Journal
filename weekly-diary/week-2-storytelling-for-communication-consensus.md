August 26, 2022

Although I had not arrived in Thailand by the moment, I have attempted my best to curate the materials and class guidelines from various sources and tried making an understanding out of it.

Speaker(s):

1. **Asst. Prof. Dr. Nuttanart Facundes**
2. **Aj. Tarntip Liuchalermwongs**

## Coursework (the 'what?') 🤷‍♂️

* Richard Turerer: My invention that made peace with lions

_More content to come._

## Further reading 📄

> * It can include the coursework, the software, and framework used, the detailed specifications, something like that!
