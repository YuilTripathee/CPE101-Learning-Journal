# Week 2 - Storytelling for communication, consensus

August 26, 2022

Although I had not arrived in Thailand by the moment, I have attempted my best to curate the materials and class guidelines from various sources and tried making an understanding out of it.

Instructors(s):

1. **Asst. Prof. Dr. Nuttanart Facundes**
2. **Aj. Tarntip Liuchalermwongs**

## Coursework (the 'what?') 🤷‍♂️

### Storytelling

**Storytelling** was the starting topic of this session. Storytelling is involved in passing the context and communicating the relevant facts and figures with an empathy. It is a great skill to portray the significance of something valuable.

* **Richard Turerer**: My invention that made peace with lions

  He delivered a very convincing talk on TEDx platform about his solution he built to keep lions 🦁 away from his father's cattle 🐄 at night. Rather than keeping this to facts, numbers and statistics, the presenter took a step ahead and provided us with the sense of relevance of his technical solutions.

  His talk was very successful since he has been personally connect with his audience and lay down the context.

About freytag's pyramid:

This gives a structure for storytelling:

- **Exposition** - backgroup plot
- **Inciting incident** - keystone incident (like a plot twist)
- **Rising Action** - how situations escalate
- **Climax** - place where wonders are at the peak
- **Falling action** - now, things start to become clear
- **Resolutions** - final message is successfully developed

### Concensus decision

We won't be making good decision based on assumptions, sense of feeling or judgement. Therefore, while agreeing to a technical decision conflict-management techniques like voting or compromising should be discarded. Instead of such measures, the decisions should be agreed by all the decision makers involved centered on logic, facts and rational though (like a conventional wisdom).

Unlike other kind of works (opposed to engineering), being open to participate in healthy conflicts brings the best in the solution we develop.

## Impact (the 'so what?') 🚀

Communication is one of the inseparable part of engineering role. Storytelling either in verbal or written form, is a must-learn skill in order to improve communication skills and leverage our collaboration with others.

Concensus decision is a widely adopted means observed in technological development trend. We can find them from as simple as hackathon project to the large consortium making technical decisions (like IEEE, W3C developing universal electronics and software standards). Decision input there involves logic, rational outcomes and the test results obtained from the experimenting with various setups or designs.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') 🤔

Using storytelling as a start, while we present technical solutions will surely leave a convincing positive impact among the audiences. We can also use such measure at the end of our showcaing to build a hook, which makes our solution to be remembered more strongly. I look forward to improve my presentation this technique.

I've learned that partial agreement in technical work is a self-destructive move to make. It has to be avoided at any cost. I've exercised concensus decision quite a lot of times in my previous projects, and looking forward to learn best technical groupwork practices more along the course.
