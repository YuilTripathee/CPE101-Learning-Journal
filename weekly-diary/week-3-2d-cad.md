Taking the first class at KMUTT on premises.

## Coursework (the 'what?') 🤷‍♂️

#### LibreCAD

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

It is open-source CAD software.

I had watched the videos posted in Facebook guide but could hardly make any sense out of them.

## Impact (the 'so what?') 🚀

How the session turned out to be of value if it did?

> * Just wondering about the syllabus.
> * Relatable to the work we do currently.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') 🤔

> * Potential applications of the works and the lessons carried out during the course.
> * Any suggestions to yourself, the organization, and other stakeholders?

## Further reading 📄

> * Here you can write the details about the coursework or the activity
> * It can include the coursework, the software, and framework used, the detailed specifications, something like that!

Here's the CAD drawing I made after learning LibreCAD.
