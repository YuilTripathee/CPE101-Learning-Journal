# Week 3 - 2D CAD using LibreCAD application

September 3, 2022

Taking the first class at KMUTT on-premises.

## Coursework (the 'what?') ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### LibreCAD

It is open-source CAD software, a really good one. Using this tool, we can create an outline that is going to be used for CNC laser cutting in 2D planes (usually acrylic).

I had watched the videos posted in Facebook guide but could hardly make any sense out of them. Luckily, I could ask for help since the class was onsite and finally learned a few starting part of the 2D CAD. I took the work back home and then finished it later. Then, a lot of things made sense about 2D CAD (e.g. line tool, divide tool, fillet tool to add curve to the edge to name a few.)

We also visited the InnoX lab at KMUTT (Engineering Building) and observed the 2D CAD work came to reality using CNC laser cutter. After the end of session, we were given a safety exam which was mandatory in order to work with core tools of Innovation Exchange at KMUTT.

Also, the professor provided additional information about engineering drawing and the general practices all around the world.

## Impact (the 'so what?') üöÄ

We still require 2D CAD even in computer engineering projects. It lets us create complex shapes on plane surfaces which would be a nightmare if had to be done manually using hands. LibreCAD also has an advantage to run on Windows, Apple and Linux, while AutoCAD is not supported in Linux. Robotics enthusiasts working in Linux platform extensively will have the benefit of not requiring to leave the platform just for preparing CAD drawing, if they use LibreCAD.

And, we can not deny the fact that computer hardware project demands parts obtained from 2D CNC (like PNP machines, CNC laser cutters). Therefore, 2D CAD is an essential skill to have.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') ü§î

I also got to meet Thai friends and international students in person. Plus, we were going to have **acryclic casing** in our **robots** (upcoming project). The practise in this session is surely going to add value in the coming project.

Furthermore, constructing things out of sheets (steel, acrylic or even aluminum) is more rigid and **does not degrade** with time (as seen in ABS plastic). So, 2D CAD happend to a must-learn skill if we want to work closely with computer hardware projects.

Here's the CAD drawing I made after learning LibreCAD.
