# Week 4 - 3D CAD Drawing using Constructive Solid Geometry

September 9, 2022

Using TinkerCAD web application.

## Coursework (the 'what?') 🤷‍♂️

### Constructive Solid Geometry

* We start with the primitive shapes (cone, cylinder, cub, etc.)
* We use these shapes to make new shapes, therefore the term constructive solid geometry.
*   We can either use fill or a hole out of shape that would alter the final design.

The other process of making 3D models applies the use of Polygon mesh, which is quite opposite process from CSG. Software like Blender use this technique

### **Tinker CAD**

It is a web based tool from Autodesk Inc. which let's us prototype electronics circuits, as well as build basic designs.

## Impact (the 'so what?') 🚀

How the session turned out to be of value if it did?

> * Just wondering about the syllabus.
> * Relatable to the work we do currently.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') 🤔

> * Potential applications of the works and the lessons carried out during the course.
> * Any suggestions to yourself, the organization, and other stakeholders?

> For a good quality of work, I would least recommend TinkerCAD and rather opt for solutions like Fusion 360, DS Solidworks.
