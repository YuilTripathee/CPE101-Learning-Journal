# Week 4 - 3D CAD Drawing using Constructive Solid Geometry

September 9, 2022

Using TinkerCAD web application.

## Coursework (the 'what?') ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Constructive Solid Geometry

* We start with the primitive shapes (cone, cylinder, cub, etc.)
* We use these shapes to make new shapes, therefore the term constructive solid geometry.
*   We can either use fill or a hole out of shape that would alter the final design.

The other process of making 3D models applies the use of Polygon mesh, which is quite opposite process from CSG. Software like Blender use this technique.

It is also an interesting fact that STL file which is going to be used by 3D printer also uses Polygon mesh rather than CSG.

### **Tinker CAD**

It is a web based tool from Autodesk Inc. which let's us prototype electronics circuits, as well as build basic designs.

## Impact (the 'so what?') üöÄ

We were going to use 3D printed parts for the iBit robot extension (gambler robot project). Therefore, we need a 3D design tool to design such parts. Using TinkerCAD would let us rapidly create and test different design that are suitable for the build of the robot.

This activity also directly correlates with the professional roles where harware extension is also involved in the project. Some kind of mechanical parts are attached to computational system mostly in Internet of Things application.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') ü§î

Certainly, constructive solid geometry is not a right fit solution when it comes to making the best designs. Moreover, TinkerCAD is not as powerful than its alternatives, which makes it a poor choice for building 3D models.

For a good quality of work, I would least recommend TinkerCAD and rather opt for solutions like Fusion 360, DS Solidworks. Nevertheless, I would consider using TinkerCAD for rapid prototyping use cases thanks to the speed and level of comfort the tool provides
