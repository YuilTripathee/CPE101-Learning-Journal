## Coursework (the 'what?') 🤷‍♂️

### Constructive Solid Geometry

- We start with the primitive shapes (cone, cylinder, cub, etc.)
- We use these shapes to make new shapes, therefore the term constructive solid geometry.

### **Tinker CAD**

It is a web based tool from Autodesk Inc. which let's us prototype electronics circuits, as well as build basic designs.

## Impact  (the 'so what?') 🚀

How the session turned out to be of value if it did?

> * Just wondering about the syllabus.
> * Relatable to the work we do currently.

## Reflections (the 'now what?') 🤔

> * Potential applications of the works and the lessons carried out during the course.
> * Any suggestions to yourself, the organization, and other stakeholders?

> For a good quality of work, I would least recommend TinkerCAD and rather opt for solutions like Fusion 360, DS Solidworks.

## A detailed exploration of this coursework/activity 📄

> * Here you can write the details about the coursework or the activity
> * It can include the coursework, the software, and framework used, the detailed specifications, something like that!
